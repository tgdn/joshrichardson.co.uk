title: Joshua - Advertising Creative based in London.
---
I fully understand a brief, its complexities, it's limitations and what is needed to cheat all of those things and make the best creative work.

I am versed in multidisciplinary platforms across TV, print, digital, social and DM.

I'm positive in every aspect of my work and pride myself on having good common sense and a good sense of humour. 

A well rounded art director and copy writer, confident with any project and opportunity with a competent skill set of design and presentation.
