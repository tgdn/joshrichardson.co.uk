title: Joshua - Advertising creative based in London.
---
I fully understand a brief, its complexities, it's limitations and what is needed to  bend and disrupt those perimeters to make the best creative work.

I have purposely worked in as many sectors, medias and multidisciplinary platforms as possible to broaden my creative understanding. Working in B2C, B2B, TVC, social and digital, direct mail, radio, PR and content to be able to deliver on any brief for any client across automotive, fashion and sport or cyber security.

I'm positive in every aspect of my work and pride myself on having good common sense and a good sense of humour. 

A well rounded senior art director and copy writer, confident with any project or opportunity with a great skill set of design and presentation.
