  With the release of the new England Rugby shirt by Umbro I designed a set of
  concept art logos.

  I then collaborated with a photographer friend of mine - Sam Todd, to create a
  test shoot that would reimagine the modern day rugby fan.


  Many sports have negative stereotypes from by-gone generations.

  One stigma Rugby Union holds is its accusation of elitism, an upper class game
  played by the wealthy.


  The public school boys that dwell in south west London, drinking champers from
  the boots of Land Rovers is an outdated and untrue representation of todays
  Rugby fanbase


  Rugby today is a global game played from the grass routes up and enjoyed by
  boys and girls of all races, creeds, ages and abilities.

  Rugbys true values are acceptance and inclusion.


  This work sets out to demonstrate Rugby fans are from all walks of life, to
  see Rugby in a new light and to show stereotypes and preconceptions have no
  place in sport.


  Using subtle hints and hidden gems that true Rugby fans would see - The sweet
  chariot on the swings, the playground game of British Bulldog and the coaching
  technique of Total Control Under Pressure (TCUP)
