  Fare dodging costs London £100m a year.


  Fares go unpaid in a range of ways on London's transport network, from failing
  to touch in and out with an Oyster/Contactless card to the use of counterfeit
  tickets.


  Some 450 revenue inspectors are employed across the network to try to stop
  fare dodging, these inspectors are plain clothed.


  To reinforce that anyone could be a ticket inspector we created a series 6
  sheets across the underground asking “Is this what a ticket inspector would
  wear?” to make people think twice before cheating the system.
