  Last January my partner and I had the opportunity to open a pop up restaurant
  on Trafalgar Square on a year lease before the building was demolished.

  We beg, stole and borrowed to get off the ground, we went to a paint recycled
  plant for our paint, we built all of our tables, benches and shelving from
  recycled scaffolding planks and even painted a light on the outside because
  the exterior electricity was cut.


  Being entrepreneurial taught me many different lessons.


  The entire process was incredibly hard work but worth every moment.


  The experience of launching a successful business has enabled me to develop
  skills across all areas of business and I feel it has made me a more rounded
  individual.
