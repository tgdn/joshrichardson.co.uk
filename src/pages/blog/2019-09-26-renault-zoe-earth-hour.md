  Every year over 30 million people across the world switch off their lights for
  60 minutes at 8.30pm on the 30th in aid of Earth Hour.

  From the Sydney Opera house, to the Empire State building and Buckingham
  Palace.

  Last year over 10 million people across the UK took part.

  This year we wanted to celebrate an Electric car without using Electricity.

  We created a reflective ink OOH for the Renault Zoe to encourage drivers to
  take part in Earth Hour
