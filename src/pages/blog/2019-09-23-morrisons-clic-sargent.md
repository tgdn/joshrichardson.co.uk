  In 2017 Morrisons partnership with CLIC Sargent.


  CLIC Sargent is a charity that supports thousands of families

  following a child’s cancer diagnosis.


  In my research I discovered that when a child finishes a treatment

  they get to ring a special bell on the ward 3 times to mark the end of their
  treatment.


  For a child with cancer, ringing the bell is a huge milestone. It means
  they've finished their treatment and are ready to get on with life.

  The end of treatment bell inspires children with cancer to persevere and it
  brings hope for the future when things are tough.


  This was the 1st piece of content Morrisons created for CLIC and

  has raised over £8.6 million to date.
