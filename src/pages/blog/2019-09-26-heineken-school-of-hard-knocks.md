  Heineken and the School of Hard Knocks joined worked together since 2017 when
  we launched an adults programme in Edinburgh. 


  Heineken wanted to raise money for this great charity using their rugby
  sponsorship. So we invited some rugby royalty to take the hit and do a
  challenge for charity and the public take the hit finically to see the
  challenge become more difficult. 


  The challenge was a crane bungee jump at the European Cup final. The more you
  donate, the higher the crane goes. The film was shown on Facebook and live and
  broadcast at half time at the final.


  In the first year 132 unemployed men and women from the Edinburgh area
  completed the course with 70% going on to secure employment. We  continue to
  work together and to support the charity to reach hundreds more adults who are
  in need of help to radically change the course of their lives and realise
  their full potential.
