  There are 195 countries in the world.


  Out of those 195 only 1 is named after a women.

  St Lucia is the only country in the world named after a woman.


  This year for International Womenâ€™s day lastminute.com wanted to give back and
  with the gender pay gap at 18.4% it felt only fitting that all women were
  given 18.4% off all flights and hotels to St Lucia.
