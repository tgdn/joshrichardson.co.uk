  Brief - Every advertising agency portrays a strong, creative image of itself.
  If you were an agency what would your image be? The answer -  IT WOULD BE
  WEIRD


  Introducing Joshua ‘SeaBiscuit’ Richardson & William ‘Sher-khan’ North.


  This work was seen by Ollie Proudlock ( Made in Chelsea ) and his creative
  team for the T-shirt company Serge De Nimes.


  We were asked if we would like to shoot a very similar campaign inspired by
  our power pose.


  The photographs were used for the Serge Denimes  SS11 print campaign.
