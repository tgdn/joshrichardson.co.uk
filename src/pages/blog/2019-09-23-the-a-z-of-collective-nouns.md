description: |-
  Our wildlife and our language are under threat,
  poaching, deforestation and lack of education are the causes 
  of our diminishing wildlife.

  The goal of this project is both animal and literary conservation,
  to educate children and adults of forgotten or unknown collective nouns and 
  to celebrate the words and animals we are lucky enough to have.

  Through an A-Z book of hand drawn illustrations 
  of endangered animals depicting their collective noun.
