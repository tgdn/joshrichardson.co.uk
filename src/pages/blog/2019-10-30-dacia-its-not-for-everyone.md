title: Dacia - It's Not For Everyone

  The Dacia Philosophy - Simple is smart.


  A simple range with no unnecessary extras or gadgets you'll never use,
  designed to do exactly what a car should do, to get from A to B. All wrapped
  up in simple designs that aren't over complicated. But this wont please
  everyone, some people want all the bells and all the whistles, so this car
  isnâ€™t for everyone. But being the fastest growing car company in Europe
  winning award after award it's a car for the down to earth, straight-talking
  folk that understand what they want.
