  For the 2019 Rugby world cup in Japan I designed a concept that blended the
  English RFU rose and the Japanese flag.

  I contacted a Sake brewery with the intentions of running a press campaign and
  creating a new limited edition Sake, but as England fell just short in the
  final the idea was put on hold, (never mind just 4 more years...............)
